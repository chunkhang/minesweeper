# Minesweeper for Console
I am a great fan of minesweeper. Ever since Windows 10 saw the removal of Minesweeper, 
I have been craving for an easy way to play the classic game. Hence, I created this simple
game as a substitute that can be played on the console.

## Note
This game has only been tested on Windows.

## Before Starting
* Make sure [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/) is installed
* Install [colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama) package: <br />
 ```
 pip install colorama
 ```

## To Play
* Run [minesweeper.py](https://github.com/chunkhang/minesweeper/blob/master/src/minesweeper.py) using the console: <br />
 ```
 python minesweeper.py
 ```
* For the best experience: 
	* Maximize the console
	* Set screen background to black (0, 0, 0)
	* Set screen text to grey (192, 192, 192)
	* Set font size to 14
